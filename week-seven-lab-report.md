### Debugging From the Terminal

In lab seven, we have been provided with two java files in a github file, being ListExamples.java and ListExamplesTests.java. Our goal is to remotely compile and run the testing methods contained within ListExamplesTests.java. However, there lies an intentional bug planted within one of the methods contains in ListExamples.java. Below, I will present the steps that I took to remotely clone the file, compile, debug, and run the tests all from the terminal. 

* Step 1: Below is the image associated with step one, being to remotely log into my ieng6.ucsd.edu account. The exact line that I typed was `ssh cs15lwi23avz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`.
