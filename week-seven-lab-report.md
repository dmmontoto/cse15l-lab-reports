# Lab Report 4

### Debugging From the Terminal

In lab seven, we have been provided with two java files in a github file, being ListExamples.java and ListExamplesTests.java. Our goal is to remotely compile and run the testing methods contained within ListExamplesTests.java. However, there lies an intentional bug planted within one of the methods contains in ListExamples.java. Below, I will present the steps that I took to remotely clone the file, compile, debug, and run the tests all from the terminal. 

* Step 1: Below is the image associated with step one, being to remotely log into my ieng6.ucsd.edu account. The exact line that I typed was `ssh cs15lwi23avz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`.

* Step 2: Below is the image associated with step two, which is to remotely clone the git file. The exact line used was `git clone git@github.com:dmmontoto/lab7.git`. You might notice how the line is different from the https:// link to clone the file. The reasoning behind this different is that I am using SSH Keys for GitHub.
